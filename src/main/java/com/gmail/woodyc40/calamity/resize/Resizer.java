 * The resizing component specification.

 * <p>Resizing logic should be implemented by developers who
 * find that the default is unsatisfactory or have very
 * specific needs of the buffer, such as disabling resizing
 * altogether.</p>
 *
 * <p>Resizing is completely handled by this method, and
 * implementors should call
 * {@link com.gmail.woodyc40.calamity.bytes.ByteStore#setLength(int)}
 * whenever necessary to achieve the desired effects of the
 * resizing operation.</p>
 *
 * <p>Resizing need not be done on every invocation of this
 * method, in fact, it is highly discouraged as it may not
 * be necessary to even resize at all. Implementors should
 * check the length and desired length of allocated memory
 * at all times.</p>
